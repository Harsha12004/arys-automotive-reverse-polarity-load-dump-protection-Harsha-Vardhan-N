This is the baseline condition of the automotive input protection circuit — a normal 12 V car battery connected with correct polarity and no faults.
Battery Test – Normal Operating Condition
The battery test verifies the behavior of the circuit when a 12 V automotive battery is connected normally without any faults. The waveform shows a perfectly flat 12 V line from 0 to 20 ms, indicating a stable DC supply.A 100 Ω resistive load draws a constant 0.12 A, and because the circuit contains no diodes or transient suppression devices in this step, the voltage appears undisturbed.This graph establishes the baseline performance of the system before introducing reverse polarity or load-dump disturbances.
